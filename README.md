# Simple Malware Scanner for Executable Files

## Overview

The Simple Malware Scanner is a lightweight Python script designed to detect potentially malicious .exe files on your Windows system. This tool scans executable files for known patterns and hashes associated with malware. Ideal for users seeking a straightforward way to monitor their system for potential threats, it provides alerts for suspicious files based on content and hash values.

## Features

- Malware Content Detection: Scans .exe files for patterns and indicators commonly associated with malware.
- Hash-based Malware Detection: Compares file hashes against a list of known malware hashes.
- Color-Coded Alerts: Provides clear, color-coded alerts for detected malware and errors.
- Interactive Exit: Waits for user input before closing, allowing you to review the results of the scan.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries required

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bimantaraz/Simple-Malware-Scanner.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Run the Script:

   ```
   python scanner.py
   ```

   The script will start scanning executable files in your user profile directory for potential malware.

## Compiling to an Executable

To convert the Python script into a standalone executable file, you can use PyInstaller. Follow these steps:

1. Install PyInstaller:

   Open your command prompt or terminal and install PyInstaller using pip:

   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

3. Compile the Script:

   Navigate to the directory containing your script and run the following command:

   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile scanner.py
   ```

   This will generate a single executable file in the dist directory.

5. Locate the Executable:

   After PyInstaller completes, you will find the executable file in the dist folder within your project directory. The file will be named scanner.exe.

6. Run the Executable:

   You can now run the .exe file directly from the command line or by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer.

## Usage

Upon execution, the script will:

1. Begin scanning for .exe files in the user profile directory.
2. Check each file for suspicious content and hash values associated with malware.
3. Provide a summary report of any detected malware.
4. Pause and wait for user input before closing the terminal.

## Example Output
```
Starting malware scan...
[ALERT] Malware detected: C:\Path\To\MaliciousFile.exe
[ERROR] Failed to calculate hash: [error details]
Scan completed. Malware detected:
[ALERT] C:\Path\To\MaliciousFile.exe
Press any key to exit.
```
